# Coding-With-Python-For-Beginners
Python is a language. Yes, a language just like English, French, German etc. But then why don't most people take it up. Why, in a group of 100 only some 8-10 pick it? Leave python, the programming world is just a fraction of Sport Fanatics or Literature Lovers. What makes this language unique, is it not known around the world? Well, today everyone around you has probably heard of programming. The thing that seperates you, and them (supposing you like coding) is the logic! A person who knows lets assume 7 languages then, will be able to learn python in minutes right? Nope. The sad truth is, only if the person has a foundation of logic and math (just the very fundamentals of math) then he will be able to learn the programming language. Python is not all about syntax. You can open up W3 Schools, Geeks for Geeks etc, sites that have bucketloads of wisdom, but it is equal to 0 without
logic. This repository is meant for those(Yes, I am looking at you because you must be logical so as to come here) who are passionate (and want to work hard) and logical.
